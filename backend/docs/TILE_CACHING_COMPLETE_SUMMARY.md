# Tile Caching Complete Implementation Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **DEM Data Composition** ✅
- Previously: DEM elevation data was stored in tiles but NOT composed when merging multiple tiles
- Now: DEM data is properly composed along with cost surfaces and slopes
- All route data (elevation, slopes, costs) is now fully cached and composed

### 2. **Code Changes Made**

#### In `TiledDEMCache.compose_tiles()`:
```python
# Added DEM array initialization
dem = np.zeros((composite_height, composite_width), dtype=np.float32)

# Added DEM data copying
if 'dem' in tile_data:
    dem[y_start:actual_y_end, x_start:actual_x_end] = tile_data['dem'][...]

# Added DEM to return value
return {
    'cost_surface': cost_surface,
    'slope_degrees': slope_degrees,
    'dem': dem,  # Now included!
    ...
}
```

#### In `DEMTileCache._try_tiled_cost_surface()`:
```python
# Now returns DEM data
cost_surface, slope_degrees, indices, dem_composed = tiled_result

# Uses composed DEM if available
if dem_composed is not None:
    dem = dem_composed
```

### 3. **Tile Size Handling** ✅
- Added handling for tiles with slightly different sizes (402x305 vs 403x306)
- Tiles are properly composed even with minor size variations

## Current Status

### Cached Data Per Tile:
- `cost_surface`: Pathfinding costs
- `slope_degrees`: Terrain slopes
- `dem`: Elevation data ✅
- `transform`: Coordinate mapping
- `crs`: Coordinate system
- `bounds`: Tile boundaries

### Cache Coverage:
- **180+ tiles** cached on disk
- Each tile covers ~1.21 km²
- Total coverage: ~218 km²

## For Your Specific Route

Route: Start: 40.6572, -111.5709  End: 40.6472, -111.5671

- **Tiles needed**: 4 tiles
- **All tiles cached**: ✅
- **Full data available**: DEM, slopes, and costs

## Benchmarking Ready

The system is now ready for benchmarking with:
1. **Complete data caching**: All elevation, slope, and cost data
2. **Efficient composition**: Multiple tiles merge seamlessly
3. **Persistent storage**: Survives server restarts
4. **Memory optimization**: Frequently used tiles stay in memory

## Usage

### CLI Benchmarking:
```bash
# Will use tiled cache automatically
python route_cli.py "Start: 40.6572, -111.5709" "End: 40.6472, -111.5671"
```

### Web UI:
- Automatically uses tiled cache for all routes
- No configuration needed

### Pre-cache Park City:
```bash
python precache_park_city.py  # Cache entire area
python precache_park_city.py --verify-only  # Check coverage
```

The tiled caching system now properly handles ALL data needed for routes!
