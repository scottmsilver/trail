# Tile Cache Fix Summary

## Problem
The route from (40.6572, -111.5709) to (40.6472, -111.5671) was yielding no result when using the tiled cache system.

## Root Causes Found and Fixed

### 1. Incorrect Transform in Tile Composition
**Issue**: When composing multiple tiles, the transform was being created with geographic coordinates (degrees) as the origin, but the CRS was EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator) which expects meters.

**Fix**: Modified `compose_tiles` in `tiled_dem_cache.py` to use the actual transform from the top-left tile, which already has the correct projected coordinates.

### 2. Cost Surface Initialization with Infinity
**Issue**: The composite cost surface was initialized with `np.inf`, which made pathfinding impossible in areas where tiles didn't perfectly cover.

**Fix**: Changed initialization to use `1000.0` (the obstacle cost) instead of `np.inf`, allowing pathfinding to work even in edge cases.

### 3. Missing Debug Data Initialization
**Issue**: In `bidirectional_astar`, the debug_data dictionary wasn't initialized, causing a TypeError when debug_mode was True.

**Fix**: Added initialization check: `if self.debug_data is None: self.debug_data = {}`

## Results
- Route finding now works correctly with the tiled cache system
- Performance: ~7.3 seconds for the test route using 36 tiles
- The tiled cache properly composes DEM, cost surface, and slope data
- Coordinates are correctly transformed between geographic and projected systems

## Key Code Changes

1. **app/services/tiled_dem_cache.py** (~line 260-295):
   - Fixed composite transform calculation to use actual tile transforms
   - Changed cost surface initialization from `np.inf` to `1000.0`

2. **app/services/dem_tile_cache.py** (~line 1492):
   - Added debug_data initialization in bidirectional_astar

The system now successfully finds routes using the efficient tiled caching approach.
