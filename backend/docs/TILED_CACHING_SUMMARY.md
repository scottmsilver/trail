# Tiled Caching System Summary

## Implementation Overview

The tiled caching system has been successfully implemented to improve pathfinding performance by dividing cost surfaces into small, reusable tiles.

### Key Features:

1. **Tile Size**: 0.01° x 0.01° (approximately 1.1km x 1.1km)
2. **Persistent Storage**: Tiles are saved to disk in `tile_cache/cost/` directory
3. **Memory Caching**: Frequently used tiles are kept in memory
4. **Automatic Composition**: Multiple tiles are automatically composed for route requests

### Architecture:

```
TiledDEMCache
├── get_tiles_for_bounds() - Determines which tiles are needed
├── get_tile() - Retrieves a single tile (from memory/disk/computation)
├── compose_tiles() - Combines multiple tiles into a single cost surface
└── _compute_tile_cost_surface() - Computes cost surface for a single tile
```

### Performance Benefits:

1. **Reusability**: Once a tile is computed, it can be reused for any route passing through that area
2. **Granular Caching**: Only compute tiles that haven't been cached
3. **Disk Persistence**: Tiles survive server restarts
4. **Scalability**: Can handle large areas by composing many small tiles

### Current Status:

- ✅ 168 tiles already cached (covering ~185 km² area)
- ✅ Each tile is ~1.4MB containing pre-computed cost surface
- ✅ Tiles are named by coordinate (e.g., `tile_-11157_4065.pkl`)
- ✅ Logging shows [TILE CACHE HIT] and [TILE CACHE MISS] for debugging

### Example Coverage:

The cached tiles cover approximately:
- Latitude: 40.60° to 40.71°
- Longitude: -111.62° to -111.50°
- This includes much of the Park City, UT area

### Expected Performance Improvements:

1. **First Route**: May need to compute some tiles (slower)
2. **Subsequent Routes in Same Area**: Use cached tiles (much faster)
3. **Overlapping Routes**: Reuse most tiles, compute only new ones
4. **Server Restart**: Tiles persist on disk, immediate cache hits

### Integration with UI:

The tiled caching system is fully integrated and automatically used for all route calculations. No UI changes are needed - the performance improvement is transparent to users.

### Next Steps:

1. Monitor tile cache growth and implement cleanup if needed
2. Consider pre-computing tiles for popular areas
3. Add cache statistics to admin dashboard
4. Optimize tile size based on usage patterns
