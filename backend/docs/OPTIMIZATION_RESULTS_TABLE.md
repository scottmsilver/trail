## Optimizations to Avoid

❌ **Do Not Implement**:
- Simple neighbor/heuristic caching (adds overhead)
- Overly aggressive early termination
- Beam search for quality-critical paths
- Complex preprocessing for dynamic maps

## Expected Combined Performance Gains

Implementing the top 5 recommendations:
- Conservative estimate: **8-10% improvement**
- Optimistic estimate: **12-15% improvement**
- Path quality maintained: **>99% similarity**

## Code Examples

### Early Termination
```python
best_distance_to_goal = float('inf')
stagnation_counter = 0

while open_set:
    current = heappop(open_set)
    
    distance_to_goal = heuristic(current, goal)
    if distance_to_goal < best_distance_to_goal:
        best_distance_to_goal = distance_to_goal
        stagnation_counter = 0
    else:
        stagnation_counter += 1
        if stagnation_counter > 5000:
            return None  # Give up on unproductive search
```

### Dynamic Weight Adjustment
```python
def dynamic_weight(g_score, start_h, current_h):
    progress = 1.0 - (current_h / start_h)
    # Start aggressive (2.0), end conservative (1.0)
    return 2.0 - progress
    
f_score = g_score + h_score * dynamic_weight(g_score, start_h, h_score)
```

### Memory-Limited Search
```python
MAX_OPEN_SET_SIZE = 10000

if len(open_set) > MAX_OPEN_SET_SIZE:
    # Keep only the most promising nodes
    temp = []
    for _ in range(MAX_OPEN_SET_SIZE // 2):
        if open_set:
            temp.append(heappop(open_set))
    open_set = temp
    heapify(open_set)
```

## Conclusion

The most effective optimizations are surprisingly simple:
1. Stop searching when not making progress
2. Limit memory usage to improve cache performance  
3. Adjust heuristic weight dynamically
4. Use hierarchical approaches for long paths

Complex preprocessing methods (CH, highway hierarchies) provide good results but require significant implementation effort and are best suited for static maps with many queries.
