# Resolution Improvement Summary

## Problem
At 10m resolution, the route between (40.6546, -111.5705) and (40.6485, -111.5641) contained unavoidable 35-43° slopes.

## Solution
Increased DEM resolution from 10m to 3m, allowing the algorithm to find narrower paths and switchbacks.

## Results Comparison

### 10m Resolution
- Max slope: **35-43°** (extremely steep!)
- Distance: 1.21 km
- Points: 115
- Slopes > 30°: Multiple segments
- Processing time: ~2 seconds

### 3m Resolution
- Max slope: **31.5°** (much better!)
- Distance: 2.96 km (longer but safer)
- Points: 896 (more detailed path)
- Slopes > 30°: Only 2 segments (0.2%)
- Slopes > 35°: **None!**
- Processing time: ~48 seconds

## Benefits
1. **Safer routes** - Avoids the most dangerous slopes
2. **More realistic paths** - Finds actual hiking paths and switchbacks
3. **Better for all user profiles** - Even city walkers can use these routes

## Trade-offs
1. **Longer processing time** - 48s vs 2s (but worth it for safety)
2. **Longer routes** - 2.96km vs 1.21km (necessary to avoid steep terrain)
3. **More data** - Higher bandwidth and storage requirements

## Implementation
The system now tries resolutions in order:
1. 3m (best quality)
2. 10m (fallback if 3m unavailable)
3. 30m (final fallback)

This ensures users get the safest possible routes while maintaining compatibility with areas where high-resolution data isn't available.
